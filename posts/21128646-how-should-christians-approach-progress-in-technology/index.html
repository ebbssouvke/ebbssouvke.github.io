New innovations are continuously being introduced while older ones have already become an integral part of our day-to-day lives. This is an era of fast connectivity, artificial intelligence, bionic limbs, and self-driving cars. However, just as with every other aspect of life, there are appropriate and inappropriate ways to utilize technological progress. As followers of Christ, it is imperative that we critically evaluate any development in light of Scripture. This article aims at unpacking how Christians should approach progress in technology.\nRecognize Technology As God’s Gift Firstly, Christians should acknowledge technology as a gift from God. In the Bible, God has demonstrated his intention to bless humanity with his resources and creations (Genesis 1:29-30). Tools and resources such as agriculture (Genesis 2:15), animal domestication (Genesis 9:2), and metalworking (Exodus 31:3), all represent instances of divine blessings. As much as these ancient inventions have served mankind throughout history, modern technology represents another important chapter in God’s unending supply of blessings. Believing technology to be God’s gift challenges us not to approach it with fear and suspicion but with thankfulness, respect, and stewardship.\nUse Technologies for Good Purposes When leveraging technological advancements, believers should always direct their efforts towards noble purposes. The Bible encourages us to do everything “as unto the Lord” (Colossians 3:23). This implies that our actions ought to be acceptable before God whether in terms of work or play.\nEmbracing technology for good purposes may entail maximizing its applications to facilitate medical research, alleviate poverty, disseminate knowledge, and improve humanity’s quality of life among other possibilities. It is critical for followers of Christ to prioritize the pursuit of godly purposes over purely selfish motives or intentions that may cause harm.\nEstablish Biblical Standards in Technology Development As beneficiaries of God's blessings, believers should be active participants in the development of technology. This role includes applying biblical truths in the pursuit of technical advancements. In doing so, Christians contribute to the production of technologies that uplift rather than dehumanize our society. Biblical principles such as love (1 Corinthians 13), patience (2Peter 3:8), wisdom (Proverbs 9:10), and honesty (Proverbs 12:22) must guide Christians as they develop technology that addresses the deepest needs of humans.\nMaintain Moral Checks and Balances Besides guiding technology development, Christians must not forget their responsibility in maintaining moral checks and balances in technological progress. The rapid pace of technological advancements often creates space for misuse and abuse of technologies. Given that we live in a world filled with sinful individuals, it becomes crucial for Christian voices to be heard as they advocate for technology applications with moral integrity (Proverbs 11:9).\nConclusion In conclusion, followers of Christ approach technological progress by recognizing technology as God’s gift (Genesis 1:29-30), prioritizing its use for noble purposes (Colossians 3:23), applying biblical principles in technology development (Proverbs 3:5-6), and remaining vigilant against misuse through moral checks and balances (Proverbs 11:9). By implementing these guidelines, believers can leverage technology for God’s honor and the overall benefit of humanity.\n","wordCount":"511","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-28T18:24:40Z","dateModified":"2024-02-28T18:24:40Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ebbssouvke.github.io/posts/21128646-how-should-christians-approach-progress-in-technology/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"EBB Ssouvke","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ebbssouvke.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ebbssouvke.github.io/ accesskey=h title="EBB Ssouvke (Alt + H)">EBB Ssouvke</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How Should Christians Approach Progress in Technology?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-28 18:24:40 +0000 UTC'>February 28, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Recognize Technology As God’s Gift">Recognize Technology As God’s Gift</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Use Technologies for Good Purposes">Use Technologies for Good Purposes</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Establish Biblical Standards in Technology Development">Establish Biblical Standards in Technology Development</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Maintain Moral Checks and Balances">Maintain Moral Checks and Balances</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Technological advancements seem to be happening at an alarming rate of speed in this contemporary era.
