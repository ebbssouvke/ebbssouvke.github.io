In the construction industry, this means selecting quality materials and ensuring they are properly installed. Similarly, in the spiritual realm, individuals need a solid foundation for their lives, which must be based on unwavering truth. As Christians, evaluating what our livesare built on is crucial since we seek to grow in faith and deepen our relationship with God. We examine this idea using Scripture references in this article.\nEvaluating Our Lives: Jesus as the Foundation Christians recognize Jesus Christ as the cornerstone of their faith. 1 Corinthians 3:11 states, “For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.” While a building’s foundation determines its stability, Jesus provides the same assurance for our spiritual lives. He is the only source of eternal life, as John 14:6 declares, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but through me.\"\nThe Importance of Being Built on Solid Ground In Matthew 7:24-27, Christ teaches us the importance of a strong foundation through a parable about two housebuilders. While both build homes, one constructs on rock while the other builds on sand. When faced with a storm, the house on rock stands firm while the house on sand collapses. This parable serves as a warning against building our spiritual lives upon weak foundations such as wealth, fame, or temporal pleasure since they lack lasting stability.\nRebuilding If Necessary Despite our best efforts to establish a firm foundation for our faith, human limitations inevitably cause instability at times. As Christians, we must be vigilant in identifying weaknesses and correcting them. In Luke 6:48-49, Jesus states that anyone who hears His teachings must act accordingly: “He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid a foundation on rock; when a flood arose, the river beat against that house but could not shake it, because its foundation was firmly set.”\nEvaluating our lives and ensuring firm footing on Jesus' teachings can lead to spiritual growth. As believers, we must be prepared to confront our shortcomings and rebuild whenever necessary to achieve a strong spiritual foundation.\nConclusion For Christians, evaluating what their lives are built on is essential to growing in faith and deepening their relationship with God. By recognizing Jesus Christ as our foundation and continuously examining our own stability through Scripture and prayer, we ensure our spiritual homes remain steadfast amidst life’s unpredictable trials. As followers of Christ, we strive to construct our lives on firm rock rather than shifting sands, ultimately finding true fulfillment and eternal life.\nImage Credit: ©Amphoteric; Pixabay; License: CC0 Public Domain\n","wordCount":"454","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-12T14:59:54Z","dateModified":"2024-03-12T14:59:54Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ebbssouvke.github.io/posts/27334160-why-should-christians-evaluate-what-their-lives-are-built-on/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"EBB Ssouvke","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ebbssouvke.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ebbssouvke.github.io/ accesskey=h title="EBB Ssouvke (Alt + H)">EBB Ssouvke</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Should Christians Evaluate What Their Lives Are Built On?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-12 14:59:54 +0000 UTC'>March 12, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Evaluating Our Lives: Jesus as the Foundation">Evaluating Our Lives: Jesus as the Foundation</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="The Importance of Being Built on Solid Ground">The Importance of Being Built on Solid Ground</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Rebuilding If Necessary">Rebuilding If Necessary</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Building upon a strong foundation ensures stability and endurance through both good times and bad.
