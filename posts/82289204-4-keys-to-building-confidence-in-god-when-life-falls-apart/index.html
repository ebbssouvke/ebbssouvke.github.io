Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure because we are all connected to God. This fear of tapping into the innate power we possess limits us from receiving the blessings God has for us. Sometimes life throws us curve balls that seem to dismantle our worlds, and at these times, maintaining confidence in God can feel challenging. However, it is in these moments when we need God the most. When we face difficulties in life, it calls on us to deepen our relationship with Him, fortifying our faith that He is always with us and working things together for our good (Romans 8:28). Here are four keys to building confidence in God when life falls apart.\nKey 1: Seek God's Presence Through Prayer In times of distress, our instinct is often to be silent with God. We tend to feel as though He cannot relate or hear us in the midst of our pain, but nothing could be further from the truth. Now is the exact moment He desires to draw near to us. Enter into an intimate conversation with God through prayer. Express your frustrations and ask Him to ease your heart and mind. Asking God to help you regain your peace and confidence is also acceptable. Be honest with Him as you pour out your heart.\nKey 2: Embrace God's Word as Truth Scripture is an essential tool in rebuilding our faith when life crumbles around us. In these moments, we must remember God never leaves us or forsakes us (Hebrews 13:5). By learning and internalizing scriptures that speak to God's power and strength, we can gain a firm grip on our faith. These words will remind us we are not alone in our challenges but have a loving Heavenly Father who cares deeply for us. Reading inspiring passages daily and meditating on them will open our hearts to receive God's comforting presence.\nKey 3: Trust God as Your Providence As we face our tumultuous circumstances, we must remember God is our provider who continually supplies our needs according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19). When we fail to see His hands in every aspect of our lives, we begin to doubt His presence and goodness. In reality, He works behind the scenes orchestrating situations that will ultimately bring about good in our lives. We must trust God in these times of uncertainty, knowing He cares cor us deeply and loves us beyond measure.\nKey 4: Connect with Others in Faith It can be isolating when we experience difficulty and despair, but this is precisely the time to reach out to others in our faith community. In fellowshipping with those who believe in God, we can share our struggles and encourage one another as we seek God's direction together. When we unite in worshipping God, singing praises and praying corporately, we can find our hearts filled with hope and peace once again (Hebrews 10:25). Together, we can strengthen our confidence in God to carry us through the storms of life.\nIn conclusion, confidence in God will help us navigate even the most challenging circumstances life can throw our way. By engaging in prayer, embracing God's Word, trusting His provision, and connecting with our faith community, we are able to stand firm on our beliefs despite what life brings. May these four keys equip you in your pursuit of trusting God when life falls apart. God is faithful to hold you fast as you commit your life to Him.\n","wordCount":"598","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-13T00:11:47Z","dateModified":"2024-03-13T00:11:47Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ebbssouvke.github.io/posts/82289204-4-keys-to-building-confidence-in-god-when-life-falls-apart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"EBB Ssouvke","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ebbssouvke.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ebbssouvke.github.io/ accesskey=h title="EBB Ssouvke (Alt + H)">EBB Ssouvke</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Keys to Building Confidence in God When Life Falls Apart</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-13 00:11:47 +0000 UTC'>March 13, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Key 1: Seek God's Presence Through Prayer">Key 1: Seek God's Presence Through Prayer</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Key 2: Embrace God's Word as Truth">Key 2: Embrace God's Word as Truth</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Key 3: Trust God as Your Providence">Key 3: Trust God as Your Providence</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Key 4: Connect with Others in Faith">Key 4: Connect with Others in Faith</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>It has been said that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
